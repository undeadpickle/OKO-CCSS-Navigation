- Domain (e.g., "Number & Operations in Base Ten")
- Cluster (e.g., "Understand the place value system")
- Standard (e.g., "5.NBT.A.1")
- Sub-standard (e.g., "a, b, c" variations when applicable)

#### 3. Selection Levels
Users may select at any level:
- Entire domain (includes all child clusters and standards)
- Specific cluster (includes all child standards)
- Individual standard (includes sub-standards if present)
- Specific sub-standard
