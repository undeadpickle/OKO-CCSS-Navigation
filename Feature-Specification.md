# Feature Spec: Common Core Math Standards Navigation and Selection MVP

## 1. Overview & Strategy (The "Why")

### Feature Description
The Common Core Math Standards Navigation and Selection MVP is a web-based interface that enables K-8 educators to efficiently browse and select mathematics Common Core standards through an intuitive hierarchical navigation system. The feature provides a clean two-panel layout with progressive disclosure navigation on the left and comprehensive content preview on the right, allowing users to navigate through the complex five-level hierarchy (Grade → Domain → Cluster → Standard → Sub-standard) and select standards at any level of granularity.

### Problem Statement
Common Core mathematics standards are organized in a complex, deeply nested hierarchical structure that can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate. Educators, curriculum developers, and education professionals need an efficient way to:
- Quickly locate specific standards within the extensive K-8 mathematics curriculum
- Understand their current position within the standards hierarchy
- Preview complete standard content before making selections
- Select standards at different levels of granularity (domain, cluster, individual standard, or sub-standard)
- Navigate without losing context or becoming overwhelmed by the structural complexity

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: K-8 Mathematics Teachers seeking to align curriculum with specific standards
- **Secondary**: Curriculum Developers creating educational materials and lesson plans
- **Tertiary**: Education Administrators and Instructional Coaches reviewing standards alignment

## 2. Product & User Experience (The "What")

### User Stories / Requirements

**Epic 1: Standards Navigation**
- As a K-8 teacher, I want to select a grade level and see all available mathematics domains, so that I can quickly access relevant content for my students.
- As an educator, I want to expand domains to view clusters and then expand clusters to view individual standards, so that I can progressively explore the hierarchy without being overwhelmed.

**Epic 2: Content Selection and Preview**
- As a curriculum developer, I want to click on any level (domain, cluster, or standard) to see its complete content in the preview panel, so that I can understand the full scope and requirements.
- As a teacher, I want to see a clear breadcrumb path showing my current location in the hierarchy, so that I always understand my navigation context.

**Epic 3: Hierarchical Content Access**
- As an educator, I want to access sub-standards when they exist for a standard, so that I can view the detailed components and learning objectives.
- As a user, I want to maintain my navigation state when switching between selections, so that I don't lose my place in the hierarchy.

### Navigation Scheme
The feature implements a five-level hierarchical navigation system:

1. **Grade Level**: K, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (dropdown selector)
2. **Domain**: Major mathematical areas (e.g., "Number & Operations in Base Ten")
3. **Cluster**: Grouped learning objectives within domains
4. **Standard**: Individual learning standards (e.g., "5.NBT.A.1")
5. **Sub-standard**: Detailed components when applicable (e.g., "a", "b", "c")

Navigation uses progressive disclosure with expand/collapse functionality, allowing users to explore deeper levels without losing higher-level context.

### States
The interface supports multiple interaction states:

- **Default/Unselected**: Standard appearance for interactive elements
- **Hover**: Visual feedback when cursor is over interactive elements
- **Focus**: Clear indicators for keyboard navigation accessibility
- **Selected/Active**: Highlighted state for currently selected item
- **Expanded**: Visual indication when parent items show their children
- **Collapsed**: Compact state hiding child elements
- **Loading**: Brief transition states during navigation changes

### User Flow
1. **Initial Load**: User sees welcome message and grade selector
2. **Grade Selection**: User selects grade from dropdown, triggering domain display
3. **Domain Exploration**: User clicks domain to expand and view clusters
4. **Cluster Navigation**: User clicks cluster to expand and view standards
5. **Standard Selection**: User clicks standard to view content and any sub-standards
6. **Content Review**: Full standard content appears in preview panel with breadcrumb
7. **Sub-standard Access**: User can click individual sub-standards if available
8. **Panel Resizing**: User can drag the navigation panel border to adjust width and view more text
9. **Save Action**: User clicks save button (or presses Ctrl+S) to save current selection
10. **Navigation Continuation**: User can select different items while maintaining hierarchy state

### Designs & Prototypes

- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support

### Out of Scope
The MVP explicitly excludes the following features to maintain focused scope:
- Search or filtering functionality
- Multiple selection capability
- Export or sharing features
- Mobile device optimization (desktop-first)
- User accounts or preference persistence
- Comparison tools between standards
- Analytics or usage tracking
- Backend integration or database connectivity
- Real-time collaborative features

## 3. Technical Plan (The "How")

### Technical Approach
The feature is implemented as a client-side single-page application using vanilla web technologies. The architecture emphasizes simplicity, performance, and accessibility through:

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works with basic HTML/CSS, enhanced by JavaScript
- **Component-Based Organization**: Modular JavaScript functions handling specific UI concerns
- **State Management**: Global state object tracking current selection and expansion states
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event delegation and listeners for efficient interaction handling
- **Accessibility-First**: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML structure

### Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with proper document structure and accessibility attributes
- **CSS3**: Modern layout techniques (CSS Grid/Flexbox), custom properties for theming, and responsive principles
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla implementation with modern features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- **JSON**: Structured data storage for standards content and metadata
- **Static Hosting**: No server-side processing required, deployable to any web server
